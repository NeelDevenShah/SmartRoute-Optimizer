## Core Algorithm Design

### Distance Calculation System

The foundation of the routing system is built on accurate geographical distance calculations using the Haversine formula. This mathematical approach accounts for Earth's spherical shape when calculating distances between two points given their latitude and longitude coordinates. The formula provides precise distance measurements in kilometers, making it particularly suitable for urban delivery scenarios where accuracy is crucial.

### Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Approach

The system employs a Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm as its primary method for assessing route feasibility and estimating total distance. This approach:

- Constructs a graph where:
  - Vertices represent delivery points and the store location
  - Edges represent distances between points
  - Edge weights are calculated using the Haversine formula
- Uses an optimized Union-Find data structure to:
  - Track connected components efficiently
  - Implement path compression for better performance
  - Maintain the minimum distance spanning all points
